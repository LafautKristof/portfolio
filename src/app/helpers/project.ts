It allows users to visualize and analyze their activities with interactive maps, effort charts, heart rate data, and custom routes drawn on a Leaflet map. 
The project also includes achievements, personal statistics, and real-time updates — turning raw activity data into meaningful insights. 
It challenged me to work with APIs, data processing, geospatial visualization, and responsive UI design in one complete application.`,
