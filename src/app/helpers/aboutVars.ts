export const infoAbout = `I’m a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a strong drive to build applications that balance performance, scalability, and a smooth user experience. I enjoy turning complex challenges into clear, maintainable solutions, and see every project as an opportunity to grow both technically and creatively.

Outside of development, I’m very sport-minded — I love cycling, running, and going for long walks to clear my head. Music is another big part of my life, and it keeps me energized and focused, both during work and in my free time. These hobbies help me stay balanced, motivated, and disciplined, qualities I bring with me into my development work as well.

I value teamwork, clear communication, and building things that genuinely make an impact. I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can contribute my skills, learn from experienced colleagues, and help bring innovative ideas to life.`;

                    have gained hands-on experience by creating real-world
                    projects at home. Through these projects I learned how to
                    translate ideas into scalable applications, work with APIs,
                    and deliver polished user experiences. I am eager to apply
                    these skills in a professional environment and continue
                    learning.`;
